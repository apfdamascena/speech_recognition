a MacBook Pro with 2.7 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 and 8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3 (2015) was used.

I got a database with several people saying the word.

word analyzed: "bed" - a difficult word for the recognizer, because there is similarity with "bad".
quantity : 495 items


PROBLEMS: depending on the pronunciation and intonation,the recognizer makes serious mistakes like:"bad","bat,even "ted"
but, using recognizer.recognize_google(audio, show_all = True) it is possible to verify all the words that
the recognizer considered to be, being able to correct this recognition error.
