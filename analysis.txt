a MacBook Pro with 2.7 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 and 8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3 (2015) was used.


# word analyzed: "bed" - a difficult word for the recognizer, because there is similarity with "bad".
quantity : 495 items.

# phrases analyzed : "find the function called ABC", "write a function called square with parameter number"


PROBLEMS: depending on the pronunciation and intonation,the recognizer makes serious mistakes like:"bad","bat,
even "ted" but, using recognizer.recognize_google(audio, show_all = True) it is possible to verify all the words
that the recognizer considered to be, being able to correct this recognition error.

"WDU" means - "we don't understand". I used try/except for treat some errors.

---> conclusion: this recognizer, although it takes longer time to access a server,
brings good results. It had more satisfactory results when analyzing words than the google recognizer,
which until now was the winner in percentages, and presents a version totally free - which can be associated
with github, even from several people -. However, some phrases can contain little problems in recognition.
For example, the phrases were recognized as ['find a function called ABC',
'write a function called square with jeremy random but]. the first was totally successful, but the second one
wasn't.
